Three types of advisors: military, political and cultural. Can be placed in all countries within 'range'. 
Military would help train, provide decisions to lend equipment (at a cost), maybe even represent troops on the group.
Political could improve relations, propoganda, spycraft, do UN actions
Cultural would represent the proliferation of rock/blue jeans, religion, cult of personality?, Ideology

Military alliances, economic leagues, embargos, rivals (rival up but usually not down), spheres of influence, vassalage. Historical versions of all of these.

Each country has many factions within it, each representing some side. One will be in control of the government. They can have relations with each other. Alliances and rivals as well. They have ideology. They could overlap in ideology.
This can represent both parties in stable countries and hostile factions/rebel groups in divided ones. They represent segments of the population. They can militarize independent of the government to represent rebels. 
For instance in the united states, you might have democrats and republicans. However, as things progress you could get socalists and black/american indian power advocates.
In south vietnam, you could get viet cong, nationalists, buddhists, french remnants. 
Representing actual splitting of countries might be harder.
