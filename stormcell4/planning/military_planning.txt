Military is conducted by armies, which are presistant entities paid for by nations.
They can move 1 space per turn but are inactive the turn they arrive.
If there are armies of warring factions, there is a chance they will engage with mean time being ~3 turns
Attacker and defender is made by land control and ties are broken by army presence (fighting in neutral territory)

Army has:
	Size
	Quality
		- Controls effect once engaged
	General Quality
		- Controls engagement chance

Land has:
	Terrain-Defensiveness
	Terrain-Mobility
	Terrain-Attrition
	Populace-Prosperity
	Populace-Support/unrest for each army
	Control by each faction

Each stance has different:
-Supply usage
-Unrest effects
-Chance of meeting the enemy
-Casualities if enemy is met
-Restrictions on when it can be performed
-Modifications based on terrain


Several army stances:
-Pacify
	-Reduces unrest
	-Ok against guerilla
	-Dispersed
-Raiding
	-Semi-Dispersed
	-Retreats to aggressive
	-Effective against limited amounts of defensive
	-Increases unrest
-Aggressive
	- Most likely to meet the enemy in battle
-Defensive
	-If both defensive, low casualities
	-Entrenchment bonus if in this for long time
-Guerilla
	-Strength scales with both unrest and number of men
	-Too many men and you cant perform this
	-Only certain nations can do this
